    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
        This web app is part of a thesis project focused on enhancing the quality of space and astronomy-related images
        using a GAN-based deep learning model.
        The goal is to provide users with an easy way to improve their images through a simple, accessible interface.
        The enhancement model is lightweight and optimized to run on limited hardware resources.
